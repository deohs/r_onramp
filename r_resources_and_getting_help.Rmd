* Support through Online Forums
* How to Ask for Help
* Free Online R Courses
* Free Online R Tutorials
* Free R Books

## R's Internal Help Features

You can access R's internal documentation with functions like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example                               # Description
# ------------------------------------- # --------------------------------------
help.start()                            # Open the top-level help index
help(vector)                            # Search the help system by topic
?matrix                                 # (same as above)
help.search("RNA")                      # Search the help system by string
??hookworm                              # (same as above)
apropos("array")                        # Find objects by partial name
args(read.table)                        # Shows the arguments for a function
example(data.frame)                     # Run the example code from the package
vignette(package = "data.table")        # Show list of vignettes for this package
vignette("datatable-intro-vignette")    # Open this vignette in the help viewer
browseVignettes("grid")                 # Show an HTML page of vignettes for a topic
RSiteSearch("tibble")                   # Search http://search.r-project.org
demo(graphics)                          # Run the demo script for this package
```

As shown above, some help functions expect the argument to be quoted.

The first link provided by `help.start()` goes to [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html). 

See also: [R FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html), 
[Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) (R Project), 
and [Getting Help with R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R) (RStudio).

## R Package Documentation

A package will usually have documentation containing one or more of the following:

* index
* a DESCRIPTION file
* guides for functions (with examples), classes, and data
* vignettes, including tutorials and FAQs
* demos
* a NEWS file

The index for CRAN packages can be found using a URL like:

```
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PACKAGE/index.html
```

... where PACKAGE would be replaced with the actual package name.

Example: [tidyr package index](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html)

## R Cheat Sheets

Many R packages have [Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) 
to help with common tasks and questions.

![[R Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)](images/cheatsheet.png)

## Support through Online Forums

If you have searched [R Seek](http://rseek.org/), the online documentation, and 
the web in general -- and still can't solve your problem, you can request help by 
posting to an online forum.

### Help Forums

* [r-help](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help) - primary support mailing list
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) - programming questions
* [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r) - stats questions

### General Discussion Forums

* Reddit [R language](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/)
* Quora [R programming language](https://www.quora.com/topic/R-programming-language)

## How to Ask for Help

There are several guides to asking for help in a way which will not annoy the
support forum.

* [How to ask for R help](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/01/how-to-ask-for-r-help.html)
* [Three tips for posting good questions to R-help and Stack Overflow](https://www.r-bloggers.com/three-tips-for-posting-good-questions-to-r-help-and-stack-overflow/)
* [Seeking Help](http://r-bio.github.io/seeking-help/)
* [How to Get Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY) (Youtube video by Roger Peng)

Basically, when posting questions:

* Do you homework carefully
* Be clear, specific, and thorough
* Be respectful and mature
* Provide a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example%20) of your problem
* Don't expect strangers on the Internet to solve your homework problems for you

## Our Favorite Free Online R Tutorials

### CodeSchool's Try-R

You do not need to "register" or create an account to run the tutorial. This tutorial is aimed at first-time R users. ([Try-R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/))

### Swirl tutorials

See if you can get through all 15 segments of the "R Programming: The basics of programming in R" course. ([Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html),
[Swirl Guide](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Using%20swirl%20to%20practise%20R.pdf)) Use the alternative version, "R Programming Alt". Install it like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
install_from_swirl("R Programming Alt")
swirl()
```
